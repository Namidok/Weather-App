This project is too get weather details of a city through out the world by using a API from "https://openweathermap.org/".

Steps to get API KEY:
1. In order to get the information through an API, you will need to have a KEY in order to access the API.
2.Go on to the website "https://openweathermap.org/" and create a free account for yourself
3.After creating an account, go to the API section present on top of the page and search for "Current Weather Data" and click on API Doc.
4.We are using this built-in API request by city name "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&appid={API key}" to access the Data.
5.As you can see we have to get the API key in order to access this URI.
6.Go to your profile and click on My API keys. Click on Generate and save that API key in your notepad

STORING API KEY IN WINDOWS ENV VARIABLE
1.API keys are sensitive information that grant access to external services or resources. Storing them directly in your code, especially if you're sharing your code or hosting it in a public repository, can expose your keys to potential security risks. By using environment variables, you keep your keys separate from your codebase and reduce the risk of accidental exposure.
2.Go to settings, and search for "View advanced system settings", Click on Environment variables and click on NEW.
3.Name your variable name as you wish and in the value keep your API key.
4.You can use your Variable Name in the python code to access the key value as in Python Dictionaries.

INSTALLING MODULES
1.I recommend creating a Vitrual Environment to install the modules and run the program for better results.
2.Follow the below steps to create a virtual environment.
        # Create a virtual environment
        python -m venv venv

        # Activate the virtual environment
        # On Windows:
        venv\Scripts\activate
        # On macOS and Linux:
        source venv/bin/activate

        # Install 'requests'
        pip install requests
